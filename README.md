# prophet-challenge
Project Overview

This project analyzes Google search traffic   data for MercadoLibre to determine if fluctuations in search traffic correlate with notable financial events and stock price movements. The objective is to leverage data insights to assist in strategic business decisions and stock trading.  

Requirements  

T<!-- he project uses the following libraries:
	•	pandas
	•	Prophet
	•	matplotlib
	•	numpy


    Notebook Structure

Step 1: Find Unusual Patterns in Hourly Google Search Traffic

	•	Reads the search data and filters it to focus on May 2020, when MercadoLibre released its quarterly financial results.
	•	Analyzes unusual traffic patterns during this period.

Step 2: Mine the Search Traffic Data for Seasonality

	•	Analyzes seasonal patterns in the Google search traffic data to capture cyclic trends.
	•	These insights help in predicting future traffic based on historical patterns.

Step 3: Relate Search Traffic to Stock Price Patterns

	•	Examines whether search traffic patterns are linked to stock price trends.
	•	Attempts to draw correlations to help understand if increased interest in search traffic aligns with stock price movements.

Step 4: Create a Time Series Model with Prophet

	•	Builds a time series forecasting model using Facebook’s Prophet library.
	•	The model helps predict future search traffic trends based on historical data.

Usage

	1.	Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the cells in sequential order.
	2.	Input your data in the required format if different from the sample used.
	3.	Review the charts and model outputs to gain insights.

Results and Interpretation

The outputs include visualizations of search traffic patterns, comparisons with stock price data, and predictions using the Prophet model. The analysis may provide actionable insights into search behavior and its relationship with MercadoLibre’s financial events. -->
